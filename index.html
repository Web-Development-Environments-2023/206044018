    <h1>About me:</h1>
    <br/>
    <p class="aboutme">
      My grandfather's first name is Michael and his last name is Hickri and he was born on July 23, 1942.
      His father's name was Reuven and his mother's name was Judith, and he was the only child of his parents.
      He grew up in the Nahaliel neighborhood in Hadera, which was a place with fruit trees, pine trees, sand and private houses.
      The thing that characterized the people of the settlement was that they were military men, agricultural workers and scholars.
      My grandfather lived with his grandparents in a private house with 1 floor and 7 rooms,
       and there were other rooms that were rented out to people.
       The conditions in his home were excellent, his grandfather was a butcher and they always had plenty of meat,
      and their yard was full of fruit trees and vegetables.
      He studied at Bilo state-religious school in  Hadera and was in a youth movement called Gadna, 
      where he trained militarily and athletically.
      He was really tall and had a lot of friends.
      In addition, he was the painter of the school and he painted huge paintings and pictures from the Bible.
      My grandfather's family used to be together on holidays and all the relatives came to their house.
      On vacation days, the family used to travel.
      <br>
      He remembers the authentic Yemeni food he ate when he was a child 
      and on Saturdays he and his family would sit together under the trees in the yard to eat fruit, 
      crack kernels and tell stories.

    <h1><u>The differences between the webs: </u></h1>
    <br/>
    
    <p>
      Web 1.0 is the initial version and the websites were static, not dynamic - "you get what you see" and with basic, non-interactive design.
      <br/>
      Web 2.0 is the time that the websites were more collaborative, social and dynamic. The main change was the possibility of sharing content by users.
      <br/>
      Web 3.0 is using AI and Natural language processing therefor the websites more intelligent. The network tries to find the best information,
      <br>
     not only to present information but also to process it.

      <br/>
      <br/>
    <u>use case of search for remedy:</u>
    <br/>
    web 1.0 - Need to know where the site of drugs is through a portal, then search the page of specific drug and at the page need physically look for what is needed.
    <br/>
    web 2.0 - Write in the search engine the desired drug, then you have to physically go through the results and check which ones are relevant. 
    <br/>
    web 3.0 - Write in the search engine the desired drug, the search engine is with intelligent AI that understands the context. 
    <br/>
              In addition there were summarize of some of the pages.
              Therefore, the user knows that the returned documents are relevant to what he is looking for and it is easier for him to decide.
