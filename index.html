    <h1>About me:</h1>
    
    <p class="aboutme">
      My grandfather's first name is Michael and his last name is Hickri and he was born on July 23, 1942.
      His father's name was Reuven and his mother's name was Judith, and he was the only child of his parents.
      He grew up in the Nahaliel neighborhood in Hadera, which was a place with fruit trees, pine trees, sand and private houses.
      The thing that characterized the people of the settlement was that they were military men, agricultural workers and scholars.
      My grandfather lived with his grandparents in a private house with 1 floor and 7 rooms,
       and there were other rooms that were rented out to people.
       The conditions in his home were excellent, his grandfather was a butcher and they always had plenty of meat,
      and their yard was full of fruit trees and vegetables.
      He studied at Bilo state-religious school in  Hadera and was in a youth movement called Gadna, 
      where he trained militarily and athletically.
      He was really tall and had a lot of friends.
      In addition, he was the painter of the school and he painted huge paintings and pictures from the Bible.
      My grandfather's family used to be together on holidays and all the relatives came to their house.
      On vacation days, the family used to travel.
      <br>
      He remembers the authentic Yemeni food he ate when he was a child 
      and on Saturdays he and his family would sit together under the trees in the yard to eat fruit, 
      crack kernels and tell stories.
